/**
 * Singleton pattern
 *<p>
 * In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation
 * of a class to one. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
 * The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Critics consider the singleton to be an anti-pattern in that it is frequently used in scenarios where it is not
 * beneficial, introduces unnecessary restrictions in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually
 * required, and introduces global state into an application
