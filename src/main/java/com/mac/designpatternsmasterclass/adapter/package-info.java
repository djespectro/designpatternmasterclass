/**
 * Adapter Pattern
 *
 * <p>
 *  In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative
 *  naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another
 *  interface. It is often used to work existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
