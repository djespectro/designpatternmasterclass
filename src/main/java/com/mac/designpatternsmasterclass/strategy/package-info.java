/**
 * Strategy pattern
 * <p>
 * In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design
 * pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code
 * receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Strategy is one of the patterns included
 * in the influential book Design Patterns by Gamma et al.[3] that popularized the concept of using design patterns to
 * describe how to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software. Deferring the decision about which algorithm
 * to use until runtime allows the calling code to be more flexible and reusable.
