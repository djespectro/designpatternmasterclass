/**
 * MVC Pattern
 *
 * <p>
 *  Model–View–Controller (usually known as MVC or Model WC for the MVVC variant) is an architectural pattern commonly
 *  used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to
 *  separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the
 *  user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel
 *  development.
