/**
 * Interpreter Pattern.
 *
 * <p>
 *  In computer programming, the interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences
 *  in a language. The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized
 *  computer language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and
 *  is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client.[1]:243 See also Composite pattern.
