/**
 * Templete Pattern
 *
 * <p>
 *     In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program
 *     skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain
 *     steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. The template method is one of the
 *     twenty-three well-known patterns described in the "Gang of Four" book Design Patterns.
