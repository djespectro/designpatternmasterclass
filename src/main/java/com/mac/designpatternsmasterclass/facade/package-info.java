/**
 * Facade Pattern
 * The facade pattern (also spelled fa√ßade) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming.
 * Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more
 * complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:
 *
 * improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components
 * behind a single (and often simplified) API
 * provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
 * serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more
 * loosely-coupled code
